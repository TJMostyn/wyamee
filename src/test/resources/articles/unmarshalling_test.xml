&#x3C;P&#x3E;There is a paragraph in Paul O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s book that offers a bedside seat to the closing of a sporting life. It was a year ago almost to the day, he was 35 and the injury suffered early in the first half of Ireland&#x27;s victory over France at the World Cup meant he would never play again.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;He didn&#x27;t know this for sure but he suspected it. There is only so much a body can take. So when the operation was over he steered clear of the usual questions with his doctors. Instead, he went back to Ireland&#x27;s team base and the shelter of men who understood what he was feeling and would know the conversations he wasn&#x27;t yet ready for.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;It was right that Keith Earls was his roommate for Earls wasn&#x27;t just a fellow Limerick man. They were both Young Munster men. &#x22;Earlsy has been looking after me; dressing me in the morning, getting my food, putting me to bed. It&#x27;s been a bit of crack and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m spending my last few days in the Ireland camp rooming with him.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;If sport can be a metaphor for life, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s last few days in a rugby team are a poignant image for the ending of life. It may not be as you would wish it but better to make the best of it. Having Earls as man-servant was &#x22;a bit of crack.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;He called his autobiography The Battle and it is wellnamed. Not the battle against the English, or the French or even the All Blacks but the never-ending and unwinnable internal struggle. With enough mental toughness you can win a lot of the battles, convince yourself an ailing body is nothing but a temptation to quit and there was never a battle O&#x27;Connell ducked out of.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;You could try to tell the story of his career through the victories and the man-of-thematch performances but that wouldn&#x27;t do it. Sure, there were plenty of good days. Two European Cups with Munster, three Six Nations Championships the first of which brought Ireland&#x27;s second ever Grand Slam and on his third tour he was part of a Lions squad that won a series.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;The question should never be &#x22;who scored the try&#x22; but why was the try scored? Not how many matches Ireland won during O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s time in the team but how did it happen that after England won the World Cup in 2003, they lost seven of their next eight Tests against Ireland in the Six Nations Championship? England, you can say, were rubbish in those years but they still reached the 2007 World Cup final and history of the fixture is speckled with average England teams beating even worse Ireland teams. The years of O&#x27;Connell and O&#x27;Driscoll were as close to a golden age as ever Ireland will get and O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s book tells you how it all happened. O&#x27;Driscoll was the greater player, O&#x27;Connell the greater leader. Their influence on this golden age for Irish rugby was substantial if unquantifiable. Something though that everyone felt.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;We met at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minneapolis ten days ago. He had been asked to speak to the Europe team before the start of the Ryder Cup and to present the players with their shirts before the opening series of matches. It was an honour but his memory of it will be tarnished by Europe&#x27;s 17-11 loss to the US.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;He spent a long time believing winning was all that mattered. If you lost you hadn&#x27;t given it enough. Towards the end he mellowed and accepted that if you gave everything to be the best you could be then you could accept what came on match day.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;You are playing for Ireland, you want to be no less than 100% but you are playing at 70 or 80 because of injuries and that is heartbreaking. The mental battle that runs alongside that is probably what comes across in the book.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;On the bad days, he would tell himself that with three or four more games under his belt, he would be back to his best. The years passed, the body that got broken and repaired and broken again, wins the internal argument. You can never be 100% again and you&#x27;ve just got to make do with less.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;There was a game against Saracens (Champions Cup, January 2015) whereby something was beginning to dawn on me. I just can&#x27;t get back there and that is a real killer, especially when you are a leader and you have to be confident. When you&#x27;re struggling it is tough to be confident.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;In The Battle, he writes of Billy Vunipola&#x27;s performance in that game and the insight that came with it.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;Billy Vunipola, their back row, seemed incredible to me on the pitch &#x97; like a machine. He was making massive hits, big carries, running into tight channels and creating space with his power. Most players like that &#x97; explosive ball-carriers &#x97; tend to drift in and out of games, but he kept going. He was fit, hungry, relentless. I know he&#x27;s 22 and I&#x27;m 35, but I want to be as good in my position as he is in his. And I felt miles away from that.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;O&#x27;Connell was touched by some of the madness that made Roy Keane the most influential Premier League player of his generation. He constantly challenged his coaches and his teammates and until that afternoon against Vunipola, he never saw a rival that he felt he couldn&#x27;t match. That deeprooted self-belief, which O&#x27;Driscoll was also blessed with, underpinned everything that Munster, Leinster and Ireland achieved.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;Many Irish fans are braced for a post-O&#x27;Connell depression.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;Ireland are going to go from strength to strength. I look at the young players that are coming through, their attitude is phenomenal. We don&#x27;t have the squads that other countries have but I look at our team now and we can be every bit as good as we were in the early 2000s. I look at the example that Johnny Sexton will give the next group. He is the ultimate team man for me; fantastic player on one hand, fantastic team member on the other.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;He knows everyone&#x27;s job, makes his own job tougher by helping other people get their job done well. Great sense of humour, incredibly passionate. Willing to stick his head above the parapet for things he believes in. He is a great example for the next generation and people will come along now and model themselves on him. Ireland is in a very good place. Provincialwise it is going to be tougher, the landscape has changed, but internationally we are in a very good place.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;Another reason for the optimism is his belief in Ireland&#x27;s coach. &#x22;Joe&#x27;s way of coaching every little detail of the game is very very simple but it is not easy. He makes it simple to do, but it&#x27;s not easy for others to copy. I would have played against Leinster and found it very hard to get near their ruck ball. It got to a point where you would be asking yourself &#x27;do these guys want it more than us?&#x27; The truth is they were just far better coached than us.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;It should be mandatory for every Irish squad member to read O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s book to better understand what it takes to make a team. How many of them will, when their turn comes, accept their responsibilities as he did? He tells a story in The Battle about a young Munster player being pulled up in a video review meeting.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;One of the younger players, very talented, had given a poor kick-chase. Axel (Anthony Foley) was forwards coach. In the meeting, he stopped the video and said to the player: &#x27;We chatted a lot about kickchase before the game &#x97; what do you think of your kickchase here?&#x27; &#x22;The player went, &#x27;Yeah, sorry, sorry, I needed to go harder there.&#x27; &#x22;Later, I was looking at him out on the training pitch. I was frustrated and annoyed with his answer. Why wouldn&#x27;t you kick-chase hard enough in a Heineken Cup game? I spoke to him afterwards. &#x27;How many times did we talk about kickchase and how important it would be in the game?&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;I know, I know.&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;What&#x27;s the story?&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;Well,&#x27; he said, &#x27;to be honest, the kick was too long and I actually slowed down to stay in connection with Rog.&#x27; &#x22;As soon as he said it, I knew he had a good point.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;&#x27;Jeez, that makes sense. You know that everyone in the room thinks you didn&#x27;t bother kick-chasing hard enough in a Heineken Cup game?&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;Well, that was kinda the answer the coach wanted.&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;You couldn&#x27;t have just said that the kick was too long?&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;I didn&#x27;t think he wanted to hear that.&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;All he wanted was your opinion. You think that&#x27;s going to win us a Heineken Cup &#x97; doing that in a meeting?&#x27; &#x22;&#x27;I didn&#x27;t think about it like that.&#x27; &#x22;I walked off then.&#x22; Sexton and Jamie Heaslip will pick up the torch but it will be difficult for them to exercise the same influence. O&#x27;Connell had that almost insane desire to succeed but he policed with a human touch. He could be hard without being scathing, uncompromising but not unreasonable. And he saw beyond the obvious. When other players were frustrated by Declan Kidney&#x27;s apparent vagueness, O&#x27;Connell sensed it was just the coach&#x27;s way of encouraging his players to take more ownership of the team.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;Asked if he got more or less from his career than he should have got, O&#x27;Connell is brutally simple.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;I just think I did some silly training at times which hurt me and cost me.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;Trained too vigorously at times? &#x22;Yeah over-trained, always tried to push the boundaries and tried new things instead of having a simple menu that worked for me. I was always looking for the next thing. Whatever Jerry Flannery or Donners (Donncha O&#x27;Callaghan) did in the gym, I had to do more. I marvelled at Brad Thorn being able to play on for so long and spoke to him about it. He had a very definite idea about what worked for him. He stretched a lot, he listened to his body, he did a light weights session when he felt that was right for him. It was really simple but he is the model, 100% the model.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;Since retiring O&#x27;Connell has worked with Munster to improve their academy.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;&#x22;I have a little role that keeps me interested. Some fantastic people working in the Munster academy but one of the reasons I am really enjoying retirement is that I haven&#x27;t dived into anything yet. I haven&#x27;t committed to anything. That has been difficult for me because there will come a point where I will have to commit to something.&#x22;&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x3C;P&#x3E;Irish rugby will not want to wait too long for his return.&#x3C;/P&#x3E;&#x3C;info&#x3E;SEXTON IS THE ULTIMATE TEAM MAN. HE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION&#x3C;/info&#x3E;
